Uses strbumme's TooJpeg : https://github.com/stbrumme/toojpeg/blob/master/LICENSE

A lot of code is based on isakbm's CR2 implementation : https://github.com/isakbm/Canon-RAW

And almost all of the references for this comes from lclevy's great cr2 post : http://lclevy.free.fr/cr2/

To use, change the "myPhotoPath" line 84 in main.

TODO : 
 - Decode slices correctly
